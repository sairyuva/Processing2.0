This project was undertaken during the online course provided by COURSERA.ORG under the title "Creative programming for digital media
and mobile apps". This program is a particle system based audio visualizer. It uses minim as audio library to perform FFT. Particle 
system class is a custom class. The music or sound tracks used for the demonstration (inside data folder) belong to their respective
owner/creator. I do not intend to infringe any copyrights and they were used only for educational purpose. I will not be responsible of
